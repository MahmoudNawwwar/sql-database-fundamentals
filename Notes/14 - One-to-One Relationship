### 1 · Definition  
A **one-to-one (1 : 1) relationship** links two entities so that **each instance of Entity A is related to exactly one instance of Entity B, and vice versa**.  
Typical use cases: splitting rarely-used columns into a secondary table, enforcing optional but unique details, or modelling inheritance (*IS A*) patterns.
